## Project: UZH Study Buddy

### Project Description (max. 150 words)
UZH Study Buddy is a collaborative platform designed to connect University of Zurich students for academic collaboration. The platform addresses the challenge of finding compatible study partners and sharing course resources efficiently. Students can create profiles, join/create study groups for specific courses, schedule study sessions, and collaborate on documents in real-time. Study Buddy also enables resource sharing, with features for uploading, organizing, and rating lecture notes and study materials. The application integrates external services for weather forecasts and calendar synchronization to enhance the planning of study sessions. By facilitating peer connections based on courses, schedules, and study preferences, UZH Study Buddy aims to improve the academic experience, foster collaboration, and increase study productivity for UZH students.
